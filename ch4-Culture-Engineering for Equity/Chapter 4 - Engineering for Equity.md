# Chapter 4 - Engineering for Equity

* In this chapter, we’ll discuss the unique responsibilities of an engineer when designing products for a broad base of users. Further, we evaluate how an organization, by embracing diversity, can design systems that work for everyone.
* we’re newer still at understanding the impact it has on underrepresented people and diverse societies.

## Bias Is the Default
* When engineers do not focus on users of different nationalities, races, genders, ages, socioeconomic statuses, abilities, and belief systems, even the most talented staff will inadvertently fail their users.
* our organizations must also recognize that such unconscious bias exists and work to address it in their workforces, product development, and user outreach.
* Because of bias, Google has at times failed to represent users equitably within their products.
* The lack of representation of such users in our workforce 1 means that we often do not have the requisite diversity to understand how the use of our products can affect underrepresented or vulnerable users.
- **Example:** In 2015, the image recognition algorithms in google were classifying his black friends as “gorillas.”. Because the data did not represent the population. And this caused Google bad press.
- The technology itself is not really to blame. As a result, the algorithm returned results that caused harm to our users. The harm to Google itself should also be obvious: reduced user trust and engagement with the company.
- One way to try to solve these problems is to help the software engineering organization itself look like the populations for whom we build products.

## Understanding the Need for Diversity
* At Google, we believe that being an exceptional engineer requires that you also focus on bringing diverse perspectives into product design and implementation.
* To get to the point where we can build for everyone, we first must understand our representative populations. We need to encourage engineers to have a wider scope of educational training.
* It is also important to disrupt the idea that only people with computer science degrees can design and build products. hey are successful at building code, and applying methodologies for problem solving. However, as the aforementioned examples demonstrate, **this approach is insufficient for inclusive and equitable engineering.**
* engineers need to understand the population demographics of their users. Engineers should focus on people who are different than themselves, especially people who might attempt to use their products to cause harm. To address this challenge, engineering teams need to be representative of their existing and future users.

## Building Multicultural Capacity
* One mark of an exceptional engineer is the ability to understand how products can advantage and disadvantage different groups of human beings.
* Engineers are expected to have technical knowledge, but they should also have the discernment to know when to build something and when not to.
* It’s critical that on your journey to becoming an exceptional engineer, you understand the innate responsibility needed to exercise power without causing harm. The first step is to recognize the default state of your bias caused by many societal and educational factors. After you recognize this, you’ll be able to consider the often-forgotten use cases or users who can benefit or be harmed by the products you build.
* Focusing on underrepresented users is a clear opportunity to promote equity. To continue to be competitive in the technology sector, we need to learn to engineer for global equity.
* We cannot expect the output of a product to be valid if both the training data and those creating the software represent only a small subsection of people. In those cases, we should be willing to delay development in favor of trying to get more complete and accurate data, and a more comprehensive and inclusive product.

* shifting the focus of your industry experience to include more comprehensive, multicultural, race and gender studies education is not only your responsibility, *but also the responsibility of your employer*. Technology companies must ensure that their employees are continually receiving professional development and that this development is comprehensive and multidisciplinary.
* Change requires that each of us, individually or as leaders of teams, invest in continuous professional development that builds not just our software development and leadership skills, but also our capacity to understand the diverse experiences throughout humanity.

## Making Diversity Actionable
* Firstly, we should admit that we are accountable for the failures in the system. Deferring or abstracting away personal accountability is ineffective. Due to the lack of diversity.
* as a hiring software engineer manager, you’re accountable for ensuring that your candidate slates are balanced. Are there women or other underrepresented groups in the pool of candidates’ reviews? After you hire someone, what opportunities for growth have you provided, and is the distribution of opportunities equitable? Every technology lead or software engineering manager has the means to augment equity on their teams.

## Reject Singular Approaches ***
* We cannot take solutions that present a single philosophy or methodology for fixing inequity in the technology sector. Our problems are complex and multifactorial.
* A common methodology today is to build for the majority use case first, leaving improvements and features that address edge cases for later. But this approach is flawed; it gives users who are already advantaged in access to technology a head start, which increases inequity.Designing for the user who is least like you is not just wise, it’s a best practice. There are pragmatic and immediate next steps that all technologists, regardless of domain, should consider when developing products that avoid disadvantaging or underrepresenting users
* begin with the more comprehensive user-experience research. This research should be done with user groups that are multilingual and multicultural and that span multiple countries, socioeconomic class, abilities, and age ranges. Focus on the most difficult or least represented use case first.

## Challenge Established Processes
* Building equitable systems sometimes means challenging established processes that drive invalid results.
* Example -> hiring process and performance rating estabished process. If the answer to any of these questions in page 76 is “no,” presenting performance ratings could still drive inequitable, and therefore invalid results.
	* -> performance ratings are indicative only of how a person is performing in their given role at the time they are being evaluated. Ratings, although an important way to measure performance during a specific period, are not predictive of future performance and should not be used.

## Values Versus Outcomes
* The failure point is not in the values, intentions, or investments of the company, but rather in the application of those policies at the implementation level.
* The values:
* **Take a hard look in the mirror** -> How can we build for everyone when we do not have a representative workforce or engagement model 
- **Don’t build for everyone. Build with everyone** -> We build with our users. We need to engage our users across the spectrum of humanity and be intentional about putting the most vulnerable communities at the center of our design.
- **Design for the user who will have the most difficulty using your product.** -> Building for those with additional challenges will make the product better for everyone.
- **Don’t assume equity; measure equity throughout your systems**
- **Change is possible**

## Stay Curious, Push Forward
* The path to equity is long and complex. However, we can and should transition from simply building tools and services to growing our understanding of how the products we engineer impact humanity. Challenging our education, influencing our teams and managers, and doing more comprehensive user research are all ways to make progress.
